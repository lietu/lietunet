title: BASH playlist management for your Raspberry Pi

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>I just recently got a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which is a decent piece of hardware, but the fact that it can't really do video playback using any other player than omxplayer left me annoyed. Omxplayer isn't a very nice player, most annoyingly it's missing playlist functionality.</p>
<p>To make the Raspberry Pi a bit more useful for me, I decided to make my own playlist manager around omxplayer, and this is it.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<h5>Set up a local bin folder (optional but recommended)</h5>

<p>Why would you want to do this? Because you shouldn't be modifying the system folders with your own scripts etc. .. if you feel otherwise, feel free to modify your system any way you want.</p>

<p>Run the following commands on your BASH terminal to create a ~/bin and add it to your path:</p>

{{< highlight bash >}}
# Create the local bin folder
mkdir "${HOME}/bin"

# Set decent permissions on it
chmod 0700 "${HOME}/bin"

# Add it to your PATH in future sessions
echo -e '\nPATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/bin"' >> "${HOME}/.bashrc"

# And enable it in the current one
export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/bin"
{{< /highlight >}}

<p>If you have other terminal sessions open and want to activate the local bin on them, just run the last line from that on them..</p>


<h5>Create the scripts</h5>

<p>Create the following two scripts in your local bin, or system bin folder if you didn't create a local bin..</p>

<p><b>process_playlist</b></p>

# Where is the playlist
PLAYLIST_FILE="${HOME}/.playlist"

# Process playlist contents
while [ true ]; do
        # Sleep a bit so it's possible to kill this
        sleep 1

        # Do nothing if the playlist doesn't exist
        if [ ! -f "${PLAYLIST_FILE}" ]; then
                echo "Playlist file ${PLAYLIST_FILE} not found"
                continue
        fi

        # Get the top of the playlist
        file=$(cat "${PLAYLIST_FILE}" | head -n1)

        # And strip it off the playlist file
        cat "${PLAYLIST_FILE}" | tail -n+2 > "${PLAYLIST_FILE}.new"
        mv "${PLAYLIST_FILE}.new" "${PLAYLIST_FILE}"

        # Skip if this is empty
        if [ -z "${file}" ]; then
                echo "Playlist empty or bumped into an empty entry for some reason"
                continue
        fi

        # Check that the file exists
        if [ ! -f "${file}" ]; then
                echo "Playlist entry ${file} not found"
                continue
        fi

        echo
        echo "Playing ${file} ..."
        echo

        "${PLAYER}" ${PLAYER_OPTIONS} "${file}"

        echo
        echo "Playback complete, continuing to next item on playlist."
        echo

<p>It is pretty important that there is nothing in the file before the #!, no new lines, no nothing. Otherwise the formatting doesn't matter much...</p>

<p>Make the scripts executable:</p>
{{< highlight bash >}}
chmod +x "${HOME}/bin/"*
{{< /highlight >}}

<p>To make the playlist processing script appear in your menus, you can put the following contents in ~/.local/share/applications/process_playlist.desktop</p>

{{< highlight ini >}}
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Process system playlist
Exec=process_playlist
Terminal=True
Categories=AudioVideo;Player;
Icon=/usr/share/icons/nuoveXT2/96x96/categories/applications-multimedia.png
{{< /highlight >}}

<h5>Use it</h5>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Start process_playlist from a terminal or the menu item.</li>
		<li>Find a bunch of media files to add to your playlist, e.g. /path/to/*.avi and to start playing them run: playlist /path/to/*.avi</li>
	</ol>
</p>
