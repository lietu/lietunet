title: GRWU - Gnome RSS Wallpaper Updater
date: "2014-01-01"

<h4>UPDATE: Project in GitHub</h4>

<p>Because I wanted to make some updates to this tool, I found it more convenient to move the project to GitHub. Here's the link: <a href="https://github.com/lietu/grwu/">https://github.com/lietu/grwu/</a></p>
<p>Further updates will happen there, and only there.</p>

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>I was using the NASA image of the day RSS feed to dynamically update the wallpaper on my Windows desktops and realized I wasn't doing that on my linux desktops (which are running Gnome 3). I checked quickly and it looked like there were no existing tools for this, so I rolled my own.</p>

<h4>grwu.py</h4>

<p>Put the contents below to a file called "grwu.py" and place that file anywhere you want.</p>

# GRWU - Gnome RSS Wallpaper Updater
#
# Reads an RSS feed, picks an image out of it, downloads it and updates your
# gnome background image with that image. It is very much possible that this
# only works with the NASA image of the day feed format.
#
# Recommend using with crontab (run "crontab -e" to edit it), add e.g.:
#
# 30 * * * * export $(xargs -n 1 -0 echo </proc/$(pidof gnome-session)/environ | grep -Z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=); python /path/to/grwu.py "http://url.to/feed.rss"

<h4>Usage</h4>
<code>python /path/to/grwu.py [url]</code>

<p>If no URL is given it defaults to NASA image of the day feed, which honestly is probably the only one giving supported format RSS. I checked a few other "picture of the day" RSS feeds and they seem to be quite random in how they provide the links to the images, and didn't bother supporting them.</p>

<p>Recommended usage is that you add a line in your crontab (run "crontab -e" to edit it) to periodically update your wallpaper, e.g. to update it every 30 minutes add:</p>
<code>30 * * * * export $(xargs -n 1 -0 echo &lt;/proc/$(pidof gnome-session)/environ | grep -Z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=); python /path/to/grwu.py [url]</code>
<p>That horrible export command at the front is needed because the idiots behind the linux desktop development came up with DBUS and are now using it for everything. It pulls the DBUS session address for your running gnome session out of the environment of the running process and exports it to the cron environment before running the script.</p>
