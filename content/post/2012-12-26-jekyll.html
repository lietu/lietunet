<p>Jekyll is a tool that can be used to build static HTML websites using a HTML template engine etc., however it's not perfect by itself, and the documentation for the plugins is rather crappy at times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will need to install ruby (including -devel packages) and do whatever you need to do to get RubyGems installer.</p>
<p>More about Jekyll: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">http://jekyllrb.com/</a></p>

<h4>Jekyll Asset Pipeline</h4>
<p>Definitely worth installing is jekyll-asset-pipeline, it makes sure your CSS and JS files are combined and compressed, as well as making sure (with a little help) that LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript etc. is converted prior to this.</p>
<p>To get this working, read up on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/matthodan/jekyll-asset-pipeline/">https://github.com/matthodan/jekyll-asset-pipeline/</a></p>

<h5>Jekyll Asset Pipeline and LESS</h5>
<p>To get LESS compilation working with Jekyll Asset Pipeline, you need to add some code to the jekyll_asset_pipeline.rb file you already created. I tried to look for a ready solution, but eventually ended up combining two-three solutions into something that works.</p>
<p>It uses the node.js lessc compiler to process the files and is written in a fairly unoptimal way in general, because I haven't got a clue of how to write Ruby and this was the first thing that I got to work.</p>
<p>This is the complete contents of that file for me now:</p>

require 'jekyll_asset_pipeline'

# Additions to jekyll-asset-pipeline
module JekyllAssetPipeline

	# Compile LESS to CSS
	class LESSConverter < JekyllAssetPipeline::Converter

		# Dependencies
		require 'shellwords'

		# What filetypes we're interested in
		def self.filetype
			'.less'
		end

		# Function to convert input at @content to output via return
		def convert

			# Build a shell command to convert via lessc
			# echo "less content" | lessc -
			command = [
				"echo",
				Shellwords.escape(@content),
				"|",
				"lessc",
				"-x",
				"-O2",
				"-"
			].join(" ")

			# Execute the command and return stdout data
			return `#{command}`
		end

	end

	# Compress JavaScript
	class JavaScriptCompressor < JekyllAssetPipeline::Compressor
		require 'closure-compiler'

		def self.filetype
			'.js'
		end

		def compress
			return Closure::Compiler.new.compile(@content)
		end
	end
end
