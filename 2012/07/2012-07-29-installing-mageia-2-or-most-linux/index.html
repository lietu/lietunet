I installed my Grub on /dev/sda, which is generally the default.</li><ul><li>This setting was behind some advanced settings button in my Mageia 2 installer</li></ul><li>When the installer is done, reboot and hold down the Option/Alt key to get to rEFIt, and choose "Boot Linux from HD"</li><li>If you had to add the kernel parameters to boot into your installer disc, you'll probably have to add them to boot into your linux system. Try and find a way to permanently add the settings to Grub if this is the case (notes below might help).</li><li>Once you have logged in, Ubuntu based distributions will generally tell you there's proprietary drivers available and allow easy installation of them, you should install the Nvidia drivers for better performance.</li><ul><li>In Mageia 2, I had to find the Mageia Control Center, go to Hardware -> Browse and configure hardware, then to Videocard -> GT216 [GeForce 320M] and click "Run config tool" .. Click on the button beside "Graphic Card" and select "nv" X server, and find the "GeForce 6100 to 360" or so driver. Configure your monitor settings, save, and reboot.</li></ul><li>All done.</li></ol><p>Some notes from my experience that might be useful in other cases:</p><ul><li>I bumped into some issues with UUIDs at a few points, I found it more safe to change the UUIDs in /etc/fstab and Grub config to /dev/sda3 .. if you find your system non-bootable, try and boot into rescue mode or similar, then:</li><ul><li>Edit /etc/fstab, change "UUID=...." on the line for "/" to "/dev/sda3"</li><li>Edit your Grub config (usually in /etc/defaults/grub or /boot/grub/menu.lst) and:</li><ul><li>Forgot what to edit in /etc/defaults/grub, but it should be pretty easy to add any additional boot parameters here</li><li>In /boot/grub/menu.lst replace "root=UUID=...." with "root=/dev/sda3"</li></ul><li>Depending on your distribution and Grub version, you might need to run one or more of the following:</li><ul><li>update-grub</li><li>grub-install /dev/sda</li></ul></ul></ul><p>If you find any other useful tips for installing Linux/*BSD/similar on your Macs, let me know and I might consider adding them here.</p></div></div></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="Hugo 0.83.1">Hugo</a> | Theme - <a href="https://ublogger.netlify.app/?utm_source=https://lietu.net/&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=config&utm_term=2.0.1" target=_blank title="uBlogger 2.0.1">uBlogger</a></div><div class=footer-line><i class="svg-icon icon-copyright"></i><span>2021</span></div></div></footer></div><aside id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="svg-icon icon-arrow-up"></i>
