title: Simple Linux/BSD service monitoring script
date: "2012-09-17"

<p>Here's a simple script to monitor the status of a service via a normal control script such as /etc/init.d/varnishd as commonly found under Linux and BSD based systems .. it should be super simple to modify for most other types of systems, such as systemctl.</p>

<p>Just configure, place somewhere on the server, and set a crontab line to run it every now and then.</p>

#!/usr/bin/env bash

SERVICED="/usr/local/etc/rc.d/varnishd"

# Who should get crash notifications

# Subject of the crash notification
EMAIL_SUBJECT="${SERVICED} crash detected"
