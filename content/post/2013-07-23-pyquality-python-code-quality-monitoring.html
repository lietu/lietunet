title: Python code quality monitoring - pyquality
date: "2013-07-23"
---

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Python has excellent coding standards that everyone should follow (PEP-8) and excellent tool to check for standards-compliancy (pep8). There's also a good tool for checking various errors (e.g. unused imports) called pyflakes.</p>
<p>Running these tools manually can easily become too much of a chore, and mass running them after doing a bunch of changes can end up with a lot of issues to be fixed at once making it a chore to fix all the little issues.</p>
<p>To make following PEP-8 and keeping the code clean fairly effortless, I made a tool to monitor code quality in "real-time". It checks for changes (md5sum by default) once a second, if new files or changed files are detected, it immediately runs both pep8 and pyflakes on the file and clearly highlights any errors discovered.</p>

<h4>pyquality</h4>
<p>Put the contents below to a file called "pyquality" and place that file either in your local bin folder (if you know what that is), /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin. Don't forget to run "chmod +x pyquality" to add execution permissions for it.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<code>pyquality [--init] [--verbose] [--debug] [path]</code>
<p>Or...</p>
<code>pyquality --help</code>

<h4>Issues?</h4>
<p>Make sure you have installed pep8 and pyflakes before trying to run this tool. Run "pip install pep8 pyflakes", as root if not in a virtualenv. If you don't have "pip", you might have to install a package called python-setuptools or just figure out how to get it.</p>
