Cloud storage - ability to store files off my own computer and synchronize with all my computers
Password manager - generating and storing good passwords and giving me convenient access to them when I need it
It seems like these should be pretty widely wanted things, things that have been around for a long time, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of competition, yet I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to find any good options.</description></item></channel></rss>
